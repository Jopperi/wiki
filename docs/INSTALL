# Wiki for phpWebSite Install Procedure

IMPORTANT NOTE #1: This is a module for phpWebSite.  You have to install
phpWebSite >= 0.10.0 first as the module will not work with earlier
versions of phpWebSite.  If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first
get the code here:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included
in the docs directory of that download.

(phpWebSite 1.x.x is not supported at this time.  Support will be added in
a future release.)


IMPORTANT NOTE #2: Wiki for phpWebSite has a dependency on additional
PEAR libraries.  These libraries were not included in the phpWebSite
distribution until 0.10.2.  If you are running phpWebSite 0.10.0 or 0.10.1,
the libraries can be downloaded from:

http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Wiki
http://pear.php.net/package/Text_Diff

The packaged "Text" directory needs to be placed in your phpWebSite home
directory under /lib/pear/ or in your main pear directory.  Please note
that this module now requires version 1.0.0RC2 or higher of the Text_Wiki
library and version 0.0.5 or higher of the Text_Diff library.  Other versions
will cause unexpected results.


Once this is done then you can start installing Wiki for phpWebSite:

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.  (There is also a .zip
   file for Windows users.)

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf module-wiki-*.tar.gz

3. Move the new directory into your phpWebSite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpWebSite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you
    would run:

    mv wiki /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/wiki

4. If you haven't already done so, you should uncomment the following line
   in core/Core.php of your phpWebSite install:

   ini_set('memory_limit', '16M');

   The Text_Wiki library that this module relies on uses quite a bit of
   memory and uncommenting the above line will allow phpWebSite to use
   more memory.  If you don't give phpWebSite enough memory to use, it
   will not work properly (or at all).

5. Go to your web site and install/update Wiki from Boost.

6. (optional) In the phpWebSite conf directory, open the textSettings.php
   file for editing.  Add <code> to the $allowed_tags list.  This will
   allow code blocks in the Wiki (as well as the rest of your web site).

7. (optional) Wiki for phpWebSite has added an entry into Menu Manager.
   You need to go into the Menu Manager control panel and select the Menu
   that you would like to add the Wiki link to (or create a new menu).
   Once you are in the menu editing screen click on the "Add Module
   Default" button.  On the resulting page select the "Wiki" item from
   the drop-down box and add it.

8. (optional) Wiki for phpWebSite supports sending notes to editors.  If
   you wish to use this feature, install the Notes module (version 1.6.0
   or later) from Boost if it is not installed already. The Notes module
   is included in the full version of phpWebSite.

   You are golden.  Wiki for phpWebSite is now installed.
